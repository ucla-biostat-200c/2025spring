## What's this course about?

-   In 200B, we learn the linear models in the form $$
    y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p + \epsilon, 
    $$ where
    1.  $y$ is a continuous *response variable* (or *dependent variable*),\
    2.  $x_1, \ldots, x_p$ are *covariates* (or *predictors*, or *independent variables*), and\
    3.  $\epsilon$ is the *error term* and assumed to be normally distributed and independent among observations.
-   In 200C, we generalize the linear models in three directions.
    1.  **Generalized linear models (GLMs)** handles nonnormal responses, $y$. \
        * binary response (disease or not)
        * proportions
        * counts
    2.  **Mixed effects models** relaxes the independence assumption of the error term and allows correlation structure in $\epsilon$.\
        * Some data has a grouped, nested or hierarchical structure. 
        * Repeated measures, longitudinal and multilevel data 
    3.  **Nonparametric regression models** (GAM, trees, neural networks) allow nonlinearity in the effects of predictors $x$ on responses.

## Course description

-   Read [syllabus](https://ucla-biostat-200c.github.io/2024spring/syllabus/syllabus.html) and [schedule](https://ucla-biostat-200c.github.io/2024spring/schedule/schedule.html) for a tentative list of topics and course logistics.

-   Teaching philosophy. Usually a GLM course is taught on blackboard/whiteboard with mostly math derivations. In this course, I will start from R code and then explain the theory behind it.
